## Description:

	A simulator of a cell's world with a simple genetic algorithm. The world is a
	rectangular matrix that contains bots (cells). The bot can move, attack another bots,
	reproduce by division and eat plants and a meat. Bot's behavior is determinated
	by a gene. The gene has a fixed lenght and describes the behavior in all possible
	situations. During the division the gene can mutate. One part of parameters the bot
	inherits from its parent, another part is depended on the parameters of the world and
	a random numbers algorithm.

	So, we have all necessary conditions for an evolution process:
		* heredity
		* variability
		* fight for survival

	Three dots means that parameter can't be changed over this interface.

	Properties with prefixes 'min' and 'max' define a range for parameters that are dependt from a random choose.
	If a property with the prefix 'min' isn't exist it means a range is [0, max].

## Parameters of a basic entity:

	* current age (Age)
	* maximal age (MaxAge)
	* energy (Energy)
	* color
		
		- plants are always green
		- meat is always red
		- the entity inherits a color from its parent or modifies it during mutation

	An entity will die if its age is equal its maximum age or its energy is equal zero.

## Parameters of a cell:

	The cell has all of parent's parameters and its own that described below:

	* quantity of an energy that necessary for a division (Energy for div)
	* mutation probability, it is a number between 0 and 100 (Mutation)
	* maximum damage that gets another cell during cell's attack (Damage)
	* behavoir gene

	The gene describes a cell's behavior. The behavior depends from an entity in front.
	It can be:

		* empty field (Empty)
		* cell that has the same sort (Same)
		* cell that has a different sort (Other)
		* plant (Plant)
		* meat (Meat)
		* wall (Wall)
		* dead entity (Dead)

		Another one exists. It's "Weak". "Weak" means that a cell must attack another cell, but
		it has a low energy. A difference between an attacker energy and a victim energy must be greater
		or equal "attackCondition".

		For each kind of behavior exists a set of possible actions. At first, let's describe all of
		possible actions:

			* NONE - do nothing
			* TURN_L - turn left
			* TURN_R - turn right
			* MOVE - move forward on next an empty field
			* ATTACK - attack another cell
			* EAT - eat a plant or a meat

		As you can see, some actions have not a sense for some situations. For example, how can a cell
		attack Wall or Plant or Meat? Therefore, sets of cell's behavior defined like show below:

			* Empty: {TURN_L, TURN_R, MOVE, NONE}
			* Same: {TURN_L, TURN_R, ATTACK}
			* Other: {TURN_L, TURN_R, ATTACK}
			* Plant: {TURN_L, TURN_R, EAT, NONE}
			* Meat: {TURN_L, TURN_R, EAT, NONE}
			* Wall: {TURN_L, TURN_R}
			* Weak: {TURN_L, TURN_R}
			* Dead: {TURN_L, TURN_R, NONE}

## Cell's algorithm:

	0) Is it dead? - yes: skip, no: go to step 1

	1) Is it attacked - yes: skip, no: go to step 2
	
	2) Is it ready to divide?
		
		2.1) yes: make a division
			
			* A child cell inherits next parameters:
				* necessary energy for division (Energy fir div)
				* damage that gets another cell during an attack (Damage)
				* probability of mutation (Mutation)
				* color in case mutation isn't happened
				* gene in case mutation isn't happened

			* During a division a mutation can happen:
				* it changes one action inside a gene. a new action will be seleced randomly
				* also it changes a color of the cell

			* The child cell generates next parameters randomly:
				* maximal age
				* direction of movement
				* color in case of mutation
				* gene in case of mutation

			* A parental cell go forward

			* A parental cell sets a half of its energy to child cell

		2.2) no: go to step 3

	3) Do a genetic behavior
		
		It detect what is exist on a forward square and select a behavior from its gene.

## World's algorithm:

	One step of a simulation of the world includes next actions:

	1) The world generates plants, it depends from the parameter of the world "plantsPerStep"
	2) The world does one simulation step for each cell
	3) The world processes entities that are dead
		3.1) if a cell is dead then it transforms to a meat
		3.2) if a plant or a meat is dead then they will be removed from the world
	4) Repeat
